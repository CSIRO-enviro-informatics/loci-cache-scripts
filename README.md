# loci-cache-scripts
A collection of tool to assist in the building of the loci-cache

I am creating this repo as a placeholder for what is to come. Hopefully there will be tools to assist with the automatic creation of loci caches so its not such a manual task.

This is also a place to collect issues associated with the cache/datasets/linksets/apis/ontologies. So we can consolidate the issues and tick them off methodically.
